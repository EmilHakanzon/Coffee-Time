Privacy Policy for Coffee Time

Last updated: 2025-07-16

Your privacy is important to us. Coffee Time respects and protects the privacy of its users. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

1. Information Collection

Coffee Time does not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or contact details.

However, the app:

    - Stores user preferences, profile information (such as name, country, favorite coffee, notification settings), coffee log data, water intake and water stats locally on your device using AsyncStorage and Zustand global state with persist. This data is only used within the app to provide a personalized experience and is never sent to any server or third party.
    - Stores all water tracking (intake, stats, streaks, glass size) locally on your device.
    - Shows toast notifications for reminders and news, but no personal data is sent or shared.
    - Fetches coffee-related information (e.g. coffee types, details, recommendations) from my own data object. Not using any api for the object all is from my own. 

2. Information Sharing

We do not share your personal data with any third parties. All local data (saved via AsyncStorage and Zustand persist) stays on your device and is never shared or sold.

3. Information Storage

We do not store any personal data on our servers. All data you save (e.g. preferences, profile, coffee log, water intake, water stats) is stored locally on your device and is persisted using AsyncStorage and Zustand global state with persist. Nothing is uploaded or shared externally.

4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy as needed. Any changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately upon publication.
